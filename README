There are various examples of different data-type overflows in C++ and Java.  Also a C example showing the various byte sizes of primitive data types.

The source code is in src/ and the compiled code should be ready to run in bin/.

- Compiling -
-------------

If you want to compile any of the C++ (.cpp) files the following command should work (assuming you are in the bin/ directory):

    g++ -o dbl_max ../src/dbl_max.cpp
    
Obviously replace the file with any of the others you wish to compile.  The -o flag sets the file name, otherwise it will be named a.out.

If you want to compile any of the Java (.java) files the following command should work:

    javac ../src/FltMax.java -d ~/code/overflows/bin/
    
The -d flag is where you wish the compiled code to be placed, otherwise it will default to the current directory.
    
The C file can be compiled with:

    gcc -o primitive_size ../src/primitive_size.c
    
-o is again the file name.

Running the code should be a simple case of:

cd bin -> ./file

The results are sent to printed to the terminal.
