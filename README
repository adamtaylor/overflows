There are various examples of different data-type overflows in C++ and Java.  Also a C example showing the various byte sizes of primitive data types.

- Compiling -
-------------

If you want to compile any of the C++ (.cpp) files the following command should work (assuming you are in the bin/ directory):

    g++ -o dbl_max ../src/dbl_max.cpp
    
Obviously replace the file with any of the other C++ files you wish to compile.  The -o flag sets the compiled file name, otherwise it will be named a.out.

If you want to compile any of the Java (.java) files the following command should work:

    javac ../src/FltMax.java -d ~/code/overflows/bin/
    
The -d flag is where you wish the compiled code to be placed, otherwise it will default to the current directory.  Again, replace the names with any of the other Java files you wish to compile.
    
The C file can be compiled with:

    gcc -o primitive_size ../src/primitive_size.c
    
-o is again the file name.

Running the code should be a simple case of:

cd bin -> ./file

The results are printed to the terminal.
